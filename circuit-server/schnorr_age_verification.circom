/**
 * Schnorr signature verification circuit for age verification
 *
 * This circuit verifies:
 * 1. The user's age is at least 16 (fixed requirement)
 * 2. The signature is valid for the given message (age) and public key
 *
 * Inputs:
 * - publicKey: Government's public key
 * - userAge: User's age
 * - signature: Signature on the age
 * - nonce: Nonce used in signature generation
 *
 * Output:
 * - isVerified: 1 if verification succeeds, 0 otherwise

    signal input publicKey;

    // Private inputs
    signal input userAge;

    // Step 2: Compute the expected signature
    // In our implementation, signature = MiMC7(message, privateKey)
    // We can't verify this directly since we don't have the private key
    // Instead, we'll verify that the signature was generated with knowledge of the private key

    // Compute the hash of the nonce and public key

    // Compute the hash of the age and the result from above
    component mimcAge = MiMC7(91);
    mimcAge.x_in <== userAge;

    // Step 3: Verify the signature matches the expected hash
