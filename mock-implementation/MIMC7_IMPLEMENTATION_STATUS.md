# MiMC7-based Age Verification Implementation Status

## Current Status

The ZK Age Verification project has been successfully implemented using MiMC7 hash-based commitments:

1. **Circuit Implementation**: The circuit uses MiMC7 hash to create and verify commitments to the user's age.
2. **JavaScript Implementation**: The JavaScript implementation uses circomlibjs for MiMC7 hash calculations.
3. **Full Verification Flow**: The full verification flow works correctly, with all test cases passing as expected.

## Implementation Details

### Circuit

The circuit (`mimc_age_verification.circom`) performs two main tasks:
1. Verifies that the commitment matches the user's age and blinding factor
2. Verifies that the user's age meets the required minimum

The circuit has:
- 429 non-linear constraints
- 5 linear constraints
- 2 public inputs (ageRequirement, commitment)
- 2 private inputs (userAge, blindingFactor)
- 1 public output (isVerified)

### JavaScript Implementation

The JavaScript implementation (`pedersen_utils.js`) uses circomlibjs for MiMC7 hash calculations:
1. `initMimc7()`: Initializes the MiMC7 hasher
2. `generateBlindingFactor()`: Generates a random blinding factor
3. `createPedersenCommitment()`: Creates a commitment to a value using MiMC7 hash
4. `verifyPedersenCommitment()`: Verifies a commitment using MiMC7 hash

### Mock Implementation

The mock implementation (`pedersen_age_verification_mock.js`) simulates the flow between:
1. Service Provider (requesting age verification)
2. User Agent/Extension (generating ZK proof)
3. Government Identity Provider (issuing credentials)

## Test Results

All test cases are passing as expected:

1. User over 18 (should pass) ✅
2. User under 18 (should fail) ❌
3. User exactly 18 (should pass) ✅
4. Senior user with higher age req (should pass) ✅
5. Edge case: age 0 with req 1 (should fail) ❌
6. Non-existent user (should fail) ❌

## Advantages of MiMC7-based Implementation

1. **Efficiency**: MiMC7 is designed to be efficient in zk-SNARKs, resulting in fewer constraints.
2. **Security**: MiMC7 provides strong cryptographic security for the commitments.
3. **Compatibility**: The implementation uses circomlibjs, which is compatible with the circuit.
4. **Simplicity**: The implementation is simpler and more straightforward than the EdDSA-based approach.

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Browser Extension**: Integrate this implementation with the browser extension.
2. **User Interface**: Create a user-friendly interface for the age verification process.
3. **Government Backend**: Implement the government backend for issuing credentials.
4. **Service Provider Integration**: Create a service provider API for verifying age requirements.

## Conclusion

The MiMC7-based age verification implementation is working correctly and provides a solid foundation for the ZK age verification system. It successfully demonstrates the privacy-preserving age verification concept, allowing users to prove they meet age requirements without revealing their actual age.
