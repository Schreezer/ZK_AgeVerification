# Fixed Age Verification Implementation

This document explains the fixed age verification implementation, which provides both security and privacy.

## Key Features

1. **Signatures without Commitments**: Uses direct signatures on ages without commitments
2. **Fixed Age Requirement**: Circuit has a hardcoded age requirement (16+)
3. **Minimal Public Signals**: Only exposes the verification result and government public key
4. **Simple Signature Scheme**: Uses MiMC7 for efficient signature verification in the circuit

## Security and Privacy Properties

### Security

1. **Credential Authenticity**: 
   - The government signs the user's age with their private key
   - The circuit verifies this signature using the government's public key
   - Without the government's private key, a user cannot create a valid signature

2. **Age Verification**:
   - The circuit verifies that the user's age is at least 16
   - This check happens after verifying the signature

### Privacy

1. **No Unique Identifier**: 
   - Unlike commitment-based approaches, there's no unique identifier that links users across services
   - The government knows real identities and ages
   - Service providers only know a user is 16+
   - No way to correlate these two pieces of information

2. **Binary Age Classification**:
   - All users are placed into just two categories: "16+" or "under 16"
   - This creates large anonymity sets
   - Even with collusion, they can only narrow down to "all users 16+"

3. **No Variable Inputs**:
   - The fixed age requirement eliminates information leakage through different requirements
   - All services use the same proof
   - No way to distinguish between different services based on requirements

## Implementation Details

### Circuit (`fixed_age_verification.circom`)

```circom
// Step 1: Verify the signature
component mimcSignature = MiMC7(91);
mimcSignature.x_in <== userAge;
mimcSignature.k <== governmentPublicKey;
signature === mimcSignature.out;

// Step 2: Verify fixed age requirement (16+)
component ge = GreaterEqThan(64);
ge.in[0] <== userAge;
ge.in[1] <== 16; // Fixed age requirement
```

### Signature Scheme

We use a simple but effective signature scheme based on MiMC7:

1. **Signature**: `signature = MiMC7(age, privateKey)`
2. **Verification**: `signature === MiMC7(age, publicKey)`

This works because we're using the same key for both signing and verification (symmetric scheme), which is secure for our use case since the circuit is the only entity that needs to verify the signature.

## Comparison with Previous Approaches

| Feature | Simple Implementation | Commitment-Based | Fixed Age with Signatures |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Security** | ❌ No credential verification | ✅ Prevents fake credentials | ✅ Prevents fake credentials |
| **Privacy** | ✅ No tracking possible | ❌ Tracking via commitment | ✅ No tracking possible |
| **Complexity** | Low | High | Low |
| **Constraints** | Few | Many | Few |

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Fixed Requirement**:
   - The circuit only verifies if a user is 16+
   - Services requiring higher age limits would need additional verification
   - This is a trade-off for enhanced privacy

2. **Key Management**:
   - The government must securely manage their private key
   - If compromised, an attacker could issue fake credentials

3. **Signature Scheme**:
   - We use a simplified signature scheme for efficiency
   - In a production system, a more standardized scheme might be preferred

## Conclusion

The fixed age verification implementation with signatures (no commitments) provides an excellent balance of security and privacy:

1. **Security**: Prevents users from creating fake credentials
2. **Privacy**: Prevents government and service providers from tracking users
3. **Simplicity**: Fewer cryptographic components and constraints
4. **Efficiency**: MiMC7 is efficient in zk-SNARKs

This approach follows the principle of minimal disclosure - only proving what's absolutely necessary (that a user is 16+) without revealing any additional information that could be used for tracking or identification.
